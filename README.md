##Overview
Create earthquake map using JavaScript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data. The final project "Earthquake Challenge" consists of adding tectonic plates location on earth and magnitude earthquakes greater than 4.5. 

Three map layers were created: Earthquakes for the last 7 days, tectonic plates and earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. 
Three map tile layers using mapbox styles: streets-v11, satellite-streets-v11 and dark-v10
The Earthquake map has a legend based on magnitude.
